  "text": "Formed near Munich as a post-hardcore band, [wimpLink artistId=\"3529689\"]the Notwist[/wimpLink] gradually began to embrace a fusion of classic '80s indie pop songwriting and scruffy electronic backings indebted to [wimpLink artistId=\"3941046\"]Oval[/wimpLink] and [wimpLink artistId=\"3569016\"]Autechre[/wimpLink]. The quartet comprises brothers [wimpLink artistId=\"10371697\"]Markus[/wimpLink] and [wimpLink artistId=\"9172940\"]Micha Acher[/wimpLink] (on vocals/guitar and bass, respectively) plus programmer/keyboard player [wimpLink artistId=\"13474646\"]Martin Gretschmann[/wimpLink] and drummer Martin Messerschmid. Their self-titled 1989 debut and 1992's [wimpLink albumId=\"20253985\"]Nook[/wimpLink] were rough-and-tumble punk LPs. Third album 12 marked the group's first flirtation with electronics, though the chord structures and vocals of [wimpLink artistId=\"10371697\"]Markus Acher[/wimpLink] marked [wimpLink artistId=\"3529689\"]the Notwist[/wimpLink] more as an alternative band. The band then gained an American distribution deal with Zero Hour, and after 12 was reissued, fourth album [wimpLink albumId=\"23341306\"]Shrink[/wimpLink] -- almost entirely abstract electronic in nature -- appeared in 1998. Neon Golden (2002) and [wimpLink albumId=\"77577154\"]The Devil, You + Me[/wimpLink] (2008) were both song-oriented in nature, albeit with electronics continuing to play a significant role in the band's material. In 2013, the band resurfaced with the single \"Close to the Glass.\" The album of the same name, which boasted some of [wimpLink artistId=\"3529689\"]the Notwist[/wimpLink]'s most accessible songwriting and experimental instrumentation, arrived in early 2014. Later that year, the band issued [wimpLink albumId=\"38519994\"]The Messier Objects[/wimpLink], a collection of instrumental tracks written in the years between [wimpLink albumId=\"77577154\"]The Devil, You + Me[/wimpLink] and [wimpLink albumId=\"25934525\"]Close to the Glass[/wimpLink]. The live album [wimpLink albumId=\"64377395\"]Superheroes, Ghostvillains & Stuff[/wimpLink] appeared in 2016, capturing the second of the band's three consecutive sold-out shows in Leipzig, Germany in late 2015. ~ John Bush",
