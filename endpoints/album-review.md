  "text": "During the years between 2008's [wimpLink albumId=\"77577154\"]The Devil, You + Me[/wimpLink] and 2014's [wimpLink albumId=\"25934525\"]Close to the Glass[/wimpLink], the members of [wimpLink artistId=\"3529689\"]the Notwist[/wimpLink] kept themselves busy with solo projects and writing pieces for theater productions and radio plays, some of which are collected in [wimpLink albumId=\"38519994\"]Messier Objects[/wimpLink]. In the best possible way, the compilation lives up to its name: where [wimpLink albumId=\"25934525\"]Close to the Glass[/wimpLink] was remarkably polished and focused (and only featured one instrumental, the standout \"Lineri\"), the band revels in many different approaches and experiments on these tracks. While the percolating post-rock of \"Object 9\" and \"Object 6\" deliver more familiar sounds from the band in miniature -- and the 12-minute \"Das Spiel Ist Aus\" stretches them to epic length --  elsewhere, [wimpLink artistId=\"3529689\"]the Notwist[/wimpLink] dives into completely unfamiliar territory. The bubbly \"Object 7\" recalls vintage library music in its atmospheric brevity; \"Object 4\" reveals a previously unheard fondness for Les Baxter and [wimpLink artistId=\"13544\"]Esquivel[/wimpLink], and \"Object 10\" incorporates Latin and trip-hop elements into something unlike anything they've ever done before. [wimpLink albumId=\"38519994\"]Messier Objects[/wimpLink] is a lot of fun for those wanting to explore [wimpLink artistId=\"3529689\"]the Notwist[/wimpLink]'s more experimental side. ~ Heather Phares",
